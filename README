        pyAGE - A Python implementation of the Analog Genetic Encoding


pyAGE is a python implementation of the Analog Genetic Encoding[1] (or AGE for
short) proposed by Claudio Mattiussi and Dario Floreano.
pyAGE also uses Center of Mass Encoding[2] (or CoME for short) for the genetic
encoding of scalar values. CoME was developed by Claudio Mattiussi, Peter
Dürr and Dario Floreano.
